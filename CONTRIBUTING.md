## Issues and new features #####################################################

If you detect a problem with the RxPlayer, or if you desire a new feature,
please first [open an issue on the github's
repository](https://github.com/canalplus/rx-player/issues).
We'll try to acknowledge it as soon as possible.

If that issue is not already worked on, we will usually accept pull requests.
Those have to follow the conventions defined below.



<a name="reading"></a>
## Reading the current code ####################################################

Even if we hope the current code is straightforward, readable and commented
enough we can still admit that going blind into the codebase can be hard at
first (as it would be for any non-small codebase).

We thus encourage you to rely on [the architecture documentation
](https://canalplus.github.io/rx-player/doc/pages/architecture/index.html)
(note: this page is updated with each new version. For any older version, it can
also be found in the `doc/architecture/` directory, in the markdown format).

A good place to start would be the [file organization of the project
](https://canalplus.github.io/rx-player/doc/pages/architecture/files.html).

The code of the RxPlayer being heavily modularized, you should not need to read
the whole documentation to be ready, only the parts you want to update
(hopefully!).



<a name="branch"></a>
## Creating a branch ###########################################################

<a name="branch-name"></a>
### Naming convention ##########################################################

We follow a strict convention for branch names. They are usually under this
form: `type/alias_for_the_fix`.

This strictness mostly helps us to quickly rememorate what each PR or merged
branch is/was about.

---

The type should be one of the following:
  - `fix`: For bug fixes
  - `feat`: For new features to the RxPlayer
  - `doc`: For documentation updates
  - `demo`: For demo improvements/fixes
  - `tests`: For tests improvements/fixes
  - `code`: For refactoring code which brings no fix or no new feature
  - `tools`: For improvements related to the RxPlayer's tools
  - `misc`: For unclassifiable other improvements

---

The `alias` should be descriptive enough to understand roughly what is the
impacted code.

---

Examples:
  - `fix/dash-minimum_position`
  - `fix/webm-duration_calculation`
  - `fix/ttml-background_color`
  - `feat/dash-utc_timing`
  - `code/manifest_as_event_emitter`
  - `tests/eme-attach_media_keys`
  - `tools/webpack-4`
  - `doc/public_api_typos`



<a name="code"></a>
## Code style ##################################################################

<a name="code-lint"></a>
### Linting ####################################################################

The code style in `src` is automatically checked by a "linter", `tslint`.

It basically follows those principles:
  - 2 spaces indentation
  - 90 columns maximum
  - optimize your code for readability

You can easily check if you followed our style rules by calling `npm run lint`.

You can also check the style of the demo page (in the `demo` directory) by
calling `npm run lint:demo`, or the style of the test files (in the `tests`
directory) by calling `npm run lint:tests`.


<a name="code-types"></a>
### Types ######################################################################

We try to be as strict as possible with types:

  - the `any` type should be avoided

  - the `as` keyword should also be avoided as much as possible.

  - the `is` keyword is fine in some situations, but simpler solutions should be
    preferred.

This is to be sure we can detect as much as possible type errors automatically
with TypeScript.

Also, created TypeScript's `type` and `interface` should all be named beginning
with the letter I, for easier identification purposes.


<a name="code-forbidden"></a>
### Forbidden functions and classes ############################################

Some native functions, methods or classes should never be used to ensure
compatibility with every browsers. To work around those, we usually rely on
"ponyfills" which are JavaScript re-implementations.

This concerns the following static methods:
  - `Object.assign`: use `src/utils/object_assign.ts` instead
  - `Object.values`: use `src/utils/object_values.ts` instead

The following methods:
  - `Array.prototype.includes`: use `src/utils/array_includes.ts` instead
  - `Array.prototype.find`: use `src/utils/array_find.ts` instead
  - `Array.prototype.findIndex`: use `src/utils/array_find_index.ts` instead
  - `String.prototype.startsWith`: use `src/utils/starts_with.ts` instead
  - `String.prototype.substr`: use `String.prototype.substring` instead
  - `NodeList.prototype.forEach`: use a regular for loop instead

The following class:
  - `Promise`: use `src/utils/promise.ts` instead



<a name="demo"></a>
## Starting the demo page ######################################################

<a name="demo-running"></a>
### Building the demo and serving it ###########################################

You might want to quickly test your code modification(s) on a real use case.

For those types of need, we developped two demo pages:

  - the _full demo_ page, which is also the one used to showcase the player.

    This demo has a user-friendly interface and allow the most frequent API
    interactions.

    It also exposes both the RxPlayer class through `window.RxPlayer` and the
    rxPlayer instance through `window.rxPlayer` - both in the global scope. You
    can thus open a debugger/inspector in your favorite browser to exploit
    directly the player's API.

  - the _standalone demo_ page, which is just a `<video />` tag linked to a
    RxPlayer instance.

    In this demo too, `window.RxPlayer` and `window.rxPlayer` link to the
    RxPlayer class and the rxPlayer instance respectively.

To use the full demo page, you can build it and run a local HTTP server on the
port 8000 by running the following npm script.
```sh
npm run start
```

To use the standalone demo page, you can build it and run a local HTTP server on
the port 8001 by running the following npm script.
```sh
npm run standalone
```

Both will detect when the RxPlayer's files (or even the demo files) are updated
and perform a new build when that's the case. In that way, the server will
always serve the last local version of the code.

<a name="demo-https"></a>
### Serving the demo page through HTTPS ########################################

You might want to serve the demo via HTTPS. This is for example needed to be
able to play encrypted contents in Chrome.

Thankfully, we have an npm script which generates a local self-signed
certificate with the help of `openssl`:
```sh
npm run certificate
```

You can then run the same demo script defined previously.
The _full demo_ will now serve HTTPS through the port 8443 and the _standalone
demo_ through the port 8444. Both still serve HTTP on the same ports than
before.

Note that such self-signed certificates are usually (rightfully) considered
suspicious by web browsers. As such, you might first encounter a warning screen
when going to one of the demo pages in HTTPS. In most browsers, you can however
safely ignore that warning.


<a name="commit"></a>
## Creating a commit ###########################################################

<a name="commit-checks"></a>
### Checks #####################################################################

Every commits in a PR should pass our quick checks (linter, typescript check
and unit tests). To check if that's the case, you can run locally the `check`
script by calling `npm run check`.

In any case, the type checking and linting of the `src` directory is
automatically done before each commit thanks to a git hook.

Those checks give us some guarantees that every merged commit in the `master`
branch is stable enough.

This gives us more confidence on our code and also allows  more advanced
debugging if we detect a regression by the usage of tools such as git-bisect.


<a name="commit-name"></a>
### Naming convention ##########################################################

We have a naming convention for commits, roughly under the form:
`namespace: what the commit does`.

Adding a paragraph (by setting multiple `-m` options to git-commit for
example) to explain why you did those modifications is preferred.

The `namespace` here describe here the area of the code the commit modifies.
It usually is one of the following:
  - `abr`
  - `api`
  - `bif`
  - `buffers`
  - `compat`
  - `dash`
  - `eme`
  - `errors`
  - `fetchers`
  - `init`
  - `isobmff`
  - `manifest`
  - `matroska`
  - `sami`
  - `scripts`
  - `smooth`
  - `source-buffers`
  - `srt`
  - `subtitles`
  - `tests`
  - `ttml`
  - `utils`
  - `webvtt`

But it could be any other values you feel to be consistent with that
convention.

This namespace helps us quickly evaluate the area of the code a commit impact,
to easily evaluate where testing need to be done and to better detect a
problematic commit if a regression is detected.



<a name="testing"></a>
## The test suite ##############################################################

<a name="testing-unit"></a>
### Unit tests #################################################################

Unit tests test function implementations. Mostly to check if they give a sane
output for every input given.

Writing unit tests for new code is encouraged.

Unit tests are written in a \_\_tests\_\_ directory, itself created in the same
directory that the code it tests.

They are written with the help of the Jest library and are named the following
way: `filename_containing_the_function_tested.test.ts`.

To understand how to create a new test file, you can take inspiration from
the current unit tests.


<a name="testing-integration"></a>
### Integration tests ##########################################################

What we call integration tests are tests testing the entire API of the RxPlayer.

New integration tests are not required when a new code is added. Just make sure
that all those tests pass before doing a pull request by running:
`npm run test:integration`.

It you want to improve our integration tests, you are welcome to do so.
Those are wrote in `tests/integration` with the help of the Mocha, Chai and
Sinon libraries.

We also use a homemade library and server to serve media contents to our tests.
If you want to know how it works, we invite you to rely on the already created
tests and to read the corresponding files.


<a name="testing-memory"></a>
### Memory tests ###############################################################

Memory tests replicate simple scenarios and try to detect memory leaks.

You can also help us improving our memory tests. Those are written in
`test/memory`. The testing stack used is Mocha, Chai and Sinon.



<a name="doc"></a>
## Documentation ###############################################################

The documentation is written in the `doc` directory, at the root of the project.

The content of `doc/generated` contains an HTML version of the Markdown files
written in the other directories. It is automatically generated from those by
calling the `doc` script through `npm run doc`.



<a name="pr"></a>
## Opening a pull request ######################################################

<a name="pr-checks"></a>
### Checks #####################################################################

Before doing a Pull Request, please ensure that all integration tests pass by
calling `npm run test:integration`.

Then, please call `npm run test:memory`, which tests for memory leaks.


<a name="pr-branch"></a>
### Which branch to merge to ###################################################

Pull requests for bug fixes, new tests or documentation should be done on the
`master` branch.

Pull requests for new features and breaking changes will have to be performed
on the `next` branch.

If you don't know on which branch to do a pull request, please open it on
`master`, we will know how to redirect it to the right one.
